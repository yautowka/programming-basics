The following algorithm does not compensate for this. I'm not sure this is exactly what you want, but this is one way to randomly generate non-repeating color values: (beware, inconsistent pseudo-code ahead) //colors entered as 0-255 [R, G, B] colors = []; //holds final colors to be used rand = new Random(); //assumes n is less than 16,777,216 randomGen(int n){ while (len(colors) < n){ //generate a random number between 0,255 for each color newRed = rand.next(256); newGreen = rand.next(256); newBlue = rand.next(256); temp = [newRed, newGreen, newBlue]; //only adds new colors to the array if temp not in colors { colors.append(temp); } } } One way you could optimize this for better visibility would be to compare the distance between each new color and all the colors in the array: for item in color{ itemSq = (item[0]^2 + item[1]^2 + item[2]^2])^(.5); tempSq = (temp[0]^2 + temp[1]^2 + temp[2]^2])^(.5); dist = itemSq - tempSq; dist = abs(dist); } //NUMBER can be your chosen distance apart. if dist < NUMBER and temp not in colors { colors.append(temp); } But this approach would significantly slow down your algorithm. Another way would be to scrap the randomness and systematically go through every 4 values and add a color to an array in the above example."
269,91.0,2008-08-01T23:49:57Z,260,4,"Yes, I thought about that, but I soon figured out that another Domain-Specific-Language (DSL) would be a bit too much. Essentially, they need to interact with my gamestate in possibly unpredictable ways. For example, a card could have a rule ""When this cards enter play, all your undead minions gain +3 attack against flying enemies, except when the enemy is blessed"". As trading card games are turn based, the GameState Manager will fire OnStageX events and let the cards modify other cards or the GameState in whatever way the card needs. If I try to create a DSL, I have to implement a rather large feature set and possibly constantly update it, which shifts the maintenance work to another part without actually removing it. That's why I wanted to stay with a ""real"" .NET language to essentially be able to just fire the event and let the card manipulate the gamestate in whatever way (within the limits of the code access security)."

For a guide to embedding IronPython read How to embed IronPython script support in your existing app in 10 easy steps . Lua is a scripting language commonly used in games. There is a Lua compiler for .NET, available from CodePlex -- http://www.codeplex.com/Nua That codebase is a great read if you want to learn about building a compiler in .NET. A different angle altogether is to try PowerShell . There are numerous examples of embedding PowerShell into an application -- here's a thorough project on the topic: Powershell Tunnel"
332,59.0,2008-08-02T03:00:24Z,330,19,"I would be a bit reluctant to use nested classes here.  What if you created an abstract base class for a ""multimedia driver"" to handle the back-end stuff (workhorse), and a separate class for the front-end work?  The front-end class could take a pointer/reference to an implemented driver class (for the appropriate media type and situation) and perform the abstract operations on the workhorse structure. My philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way, just under the assumption they would be used in tandem. I would reference something like a QTextDocument in Qt.  You provide a direct interface to the bare metal data handling, but pass the authority along to an object like a QTextEdit to do the manipulation."

If you need to connect to a web services that is unknown at compile time, then you would want a more dynamic approach, where you deduce the 'shape' of the web service.

You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at Random Point Picking . Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other! Edit: Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say: n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use buckles algorithm 515 to find the lexicographically indexed color. . You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements."

The Wizard isn't as slick as SQL Compare or SQL Data Compare but it does the trick. One issue is that the scripts it generates may need some rearranging and/or editing to flow in one shot.

This way, I not only get the benefit of versioning, but updating live from dev/stage is the same process for code and database - tags, branches and so on work all the same. Otherwise, I agree redgate is expensive if you don't have a company buying it for you. If you can get a company to buy it for you though, it really is worth it!"

591,111.0,2008-08-03T00:37:03Z,580,3,"I work the same way Karl does, by keeping all of my SQL scripts for creating and altering tables in a text file that I keep in source control.  In fact, to avoid the problem of having to have a script examine the live database to determine what ALTERs to run, I usually work like this: On the first version, I place everything during testing into one SQL script, and treat all tables as a CREATE.  This means I end up dropping and readding tables a lot during testing, but that's not a big deal early into the project (since I'm usually hacking the data I'm using at that point anyway). On all subsequent versions, I do two things: I make a new text file to hold the upgrade SQL scripts, that contain just the ALTERs for that version.  And I make the changes to the original, create a fresh database script as well.  This way an upgrade just runs the upgrade script, but if we have to recreate the DB we don't need to run 100 scripts to get there. Depending on how I'm deploying the DB changes, I'll also usually put a version table in the DB that holds the version of the DB.  Then, rather than make any human decisions about which scripts to run, whatever code I have running the create/upgrade scripts uses the version to determine what to run. The one thing this will not do is help if part of what you're moving from test to production is data, but if you want to manage structure and not pay for a nice, but expensive DB management package, is really not very difficult.  I've also found it's a pretty good way of keeping mental track of your DB."
597,76.0,2008-08-03T01:38:02Z,580,1,I agree that scripting everything is the best way to go and is what I advocate at work.  You should script everything from DB and object creation to populating your lookup tables. Anything you do in UI only won't translate (especially for changes... not so much for first deployments) and will end up requiring a tools like what Redgate offers.
655,91.0,2008-08-03T11:41:38Z,650,69,"With the ""Built in"" stuff, you can't, as using 1.0.* or 1.0.0.* will replace the revision and build numbers with a coded date/timestamp, which is usually also a good way. For more info, see the Assembly Linker Documentation in the /v tag. As for automatically incrementing numbers, use the AssemblyInfo Task: AssemblyInfo Task This can be configured to automatically increment the build number. There are 2 Gotchas: Each of the 4 numbers in the Version string is limited to 65535. This is a Windows Limitation and unlikely to get fixed. Why are build numbers limited to 65535? Using with with Subversion requires a small change: Using MSBuild to generate assembly version info at build time (including SubVersion fix) Retrieving the Version number is then quite easy: Version v = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetName().Version;
string About = string.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, @""YourApp Version {0}.{1}.{2} (r{3})"", v.Major, v.Minor, v.Build, v.Revision); And, to clarify: In .net or at least in C#, the build is actually the THIRD number, not the fourth one as some people (for example Delphi Developers who are used to Major.Minor.Release.Build) might expect. In .net, it's Major.Minor.Build.Revision."

You'll then install your app, and the installer will employ giant hacks and disgusting things to set items under HKCU for them. THEN, bob will come along and log on (he, and 500 other people have accounts in the domain and so can do this). He's never used this computer before, so he has no registry. The first time he logs in, windows creates him one, but he won't have your setting. Your app then falls over or behaves incorrectly, and bob complains loudly about those crappy products from raynixon incorporated. The correct answer is to just have some default settings in your app, which can write them to the registry if it doesn't find them. It's general good practice that your app should never depend on the registry, and should create things as needed, for any registry entry, not just HKCU, anyway"

If you don't know which process has the file locked, you'll need to examine each process's handle list, and query each handle to determine if it identifies the locked file. Doing this in C# will likely require P/Invoke or an intermediary C++/CLI to call the native APIs you'll need. Once you've figured out which process(es) have the file locked, you'll need to safely inject a small native DLL into the process (you can also inject a managed DLL, but this is messier, as you then have to start or attach to the .NET runtime). That bootstrap DLL then closes the handle using CloseHandle etc. Essentially: the way to unlock a ""locked"" file is to inject a DLL into the offending process's address space and close it yourself. You can do this using native or managed code. No matter what, you're going to need a small amount of native code or at least P/Invoke into the same.

ServerAlias *.ourdomain.com Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP): list( $username ) = explode( ""."", $_SERVER[ ""HTTP_HOST"" ] ); or a RewriteRule as already suggested that silently maps user.ourdomain.com/foo/bar to www.ourdomain.com/foo/bar?user=user or whatever you prefer."

The reason is simple: If you don't do it in the setter, you have to remember that 1 to 100 limitation every time you set it, which leads to duplicated code or when you forget it, it leads to an invalid state.

That means all of the queries written above with the % and _ are not valid full text queries. Here is a sample of what a query looks like when calling the CONTAINSTABLE function. SELECT RANK , * FROM TableName , CONTAINSTABLE (TableName, , ' "" WildCard"" ') searchTable WHERE [KEY] = TableName.pk ORDER BY searchTable.RANK DESC In order for the CONTAINSTABLE function to know that I'm using a wildcard search, I have to wrap it in double quotes. I can use the wildcard character * at the beginning or ending. There are a lot of other things you can do when you're building the search string for the CONTAINSTABLE function. You can search for a word near another word, search for inflectional words (drive = drives, drove, driving, and driven), and search for synonym of another word (metal can have synonyms such as aluminum and steel). I just created a table, put a full text index on the table and did a couple of test searches and didn't have a problem, so wildcard searching works as intended. [Update] I see that you've updated your question and know that you need to use one of the functions. You can still search with the wildcard at the beginning, but if the word is not a full word following the wildcard, you have to add another wildcard at the end. Example:  ""*ildcar"" will look for a single word as long as it ends with ""ildcar"". Example:  ""*ildcar*"" will look for a single word with ""ildcar"" in the middle, which means it will match ""wildcard"".  [Just noticed that Markdown removed the wildcard characters from the beginning and ending of my quoted string here.] [Update #2] Dave Ward - Using a wildcard with one of the functions shouldn't be a huge perf hit.

Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first. Then the OS doesn't try to find a library that isn't in your path. It's klunky and a bit painful, but ensuring Java finds them and loads them all in the correct order can work."

Some details about it are mentioned below: http://www.bloombit.com/Articles/2008/05/ASCII-Encoded-Binary-String-Automated-SQL-Injection.aspx The nasty thing about this is that effectively every varchar type field in the database is ""infected"" to spit out a reference to this URL, in which the the browser gets an tiny iframe that turns it into a bot. A basic SQL fix for this can be found here: http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack. If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot. Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with.

5604,590.0,2008-08-08T03:00:36Z,5600,0,I too have always heard having an auto-incrementing int is good for performance even if you don't actually use it.
5607,581.0,2008-08-08T03:04:29Z,5600,31,"When dealing with indexes, you have to determine what your table is going to be used for.  If you are primarily inserting 1000 rows a second and not doing any querying, then a clustered index is a hit to performance.  If you are doing 1000 queries a second, then not having an index will lead to very bad performance.  The best thing to do when trying to tune queries/indexes is to use the Query Plan Analyzer and SQL Profiler in SQL Server.  This will show you where you are running into costly table scans or other performance blockers. As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html . As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals. [Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key: For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts. Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times. If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there. Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created. http://forums.asp.net/t/264350.aspx"
5608,116.0,2008-08-08T03:04:55Z,5600,7,"The primary key serves three purposes: indicates that the column(s) should be unique indicates that the column(s) should be non-null document the intent that this is the unique identifier of the row The first two can be specified in lots of ways, as you have already done. The third reason is good: for humans, so they can easily see your intent for the computer, so a program that might compare or otherwise process your table can query the database for the table's primary key. A primary key doesn't have to be an auto-incrementing number field, so I would say that it's a good idea to specify your guid column as the primary key."

In technical terms, it should be the field that every other field in the tuple is fully functionally dependent upon.  (If it isn't you might need to normalise).

Okay... try this: Build a list of candidate CompanyNames by finding LocationNames made up of mostly or all alphabetic characters. You can use regular expressions for this. Store this list in a separate table. Sort that list alphabetically and (manually) determine which entries should be CompanyNames. Compare each CompanyName to each LocationName and come up with a match score (use Levenshtein or some other string matching algo). Store the result in a separate table. Set a threshold score such that any MatchScore < Threshold will not be considered a match for a given CompanyName. Manually vet through the LocationNames by CompanyName | LocationName | MatchScore, and figure out which ones actually match. Ordering by MatchScore should make the process less painful.

6129,726.0,2008-08-08T16:47:35Z,6110,0,"Ideally, you'd probably want a separate table named Company and then a company_id column in this ""Location"" table that is a foreign key to the Company table's primary key, likely called id. That would avoid a fair bit of text duplication in this table (over 18,000 rows, an integer foreign key would save quite a bit of space over a varchar column). But you're still faced with a method for loading that Company table and then properly associating it with the rows in Location. There's no general solution, but you could do something along these lines: Create the Company table, with an id column that auto-increments (depends on your RDBMS). Find all of the unique company names and insert them into Company. Add a column, company_id, to Location that accepts NULLs (for now) and that is a foreign key of the Company.id column. For each row in Location, determine the corresponding company, and UPDATE that row's company_id column with that company's id. This is likely the most challenging step. If your data is like what you show in the example, you'll likely have to take many runs at this with various string matching approaches. Once all rows in Location have a company_id value, then you can ALTER the Company table to add a NOT NULL constraint to the company_id column (assuming that every location must have a company, which seems reasonable). If you can make a copy of your Location table, you can gradually build up a series of SQL statements to populate the company_id foreign key. If you make a mistake, you can just start over and rerun the script up to the point of failure."

For instance, you and a collegue both check out a fresh copy, and start working on the same file. At some point, your collegue checks in his modifications. When you attempt to do the same, you get the checksum problem you have. If you now make copies of your changed files, do a fresh checkout, then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in. If you didn't get the problem in this case, when you got around to checkin in your modifications, you would need to update your working copy first, and possibly handle a conflict with your file.

If this is the case then I'm not sure why you're creating a thread per work item. Maybe you could expand? If you did need to wait for a thread to complete the you could just do: t.Join();"
7101,878.0,2008-08-10T08:37:28Z,6890,5,"How much order do you need to impose on the threads? If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer. To add more detail to Kevin Kenny's answer, you should call Join outside the loop. This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started: // Start all of the threads.
List<Thread> startedThreads = new List<Thread>();
foreach (...) {
  Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyMethod));
  thread.Start();
  startedThreads.Add(thread);
}

// Wait for all of the threads to finish.
foreach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {
  thread.Join();
} In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish. If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor."

We have a C# application that loads dynamic VB.NET scripts (although any .NET language could be easily supported - VB was chosen because the customisation team came from an ASP background). Using .NET's CodeDom we compile the scripts from the database, using the VB CodeDomProvider (annoyingly it defaults to .NET 2, if you want to support 3.5 features you need to pass a dictionary with ""CompilerVersion"" = ""v3.5"" to its constructor). Use the CodeDomProvider.CompileAssemblyFromSource method to compile it (you can pass settings to force it to compile in memory only. This would result in hundreds of assemblies in memory, but you could put all the dynamic classes' code together into a single assembly, and recompile the whole lot when any change.

You could use the old-school C way and call fopen/fread/fclose, or you could use the C++ fstream facilities (ifstream/ofstream), or if you're using MFC, use the CFile class, which provides functions to accomplish actual file operations. All of these are suitable for both text and binary, though none have a specific readline functionality. What you'd most likely do instead in that case is use the fstream classes (fstream.h) and use the stream operators (<< and >>) or the read function to read/write blocks of text: int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
myfile.open(""<path to file>"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
myfile.close(); Note that, if you're using Visual Studio 2005 or higher, traditional fstream may not be available (there's a new Microsoft implementation, which is slightly different, but accomplishes the same thing)."

The problem with a classic example is that you are forced to close the file by yourself, meaning that you will have to bend your architecture to this need. RAII makes use of the automatic destructor call in C++ to close the file for you. Update : seems that std::fstream already implements RAII so the code below is useless. I'll keep it here for posterity and as an example of RAII. class FileOpener
{
public:
    FileOpener(std::fstream& file, const char* fileName): m_file(file)
    { 
        m_file.open(fileName); 
    }
    ~FileOpeneer()
    { 
        file.close(); 
    }

private:
    std::fstream& m_file;
}; You can now use this class in your code like this: int nsize = 10;
char *somedata;
ifstream myfile;
FileOpener opener(myfile, ""<path to file>"");
myfile.read(somedata,nsize);
// myfile is closed automatically when opener destructor is called Learning how RAII works can save you some headaches and some major memory management bugs."

To get started with linq, in all its many forms, I suggest the book Pro Linq by Joseph C. Rattz. It's an excellent overview of Linq. He takes a ground-up approach, first describing all the language features (like Lambda Expressions and Expression Trees) that Linq is built on, and then moving on to some standard linq provider implementations. Additionally, here's a pretty good MSDN article describing Linq: LINQ: .NET Language-Integrated Query Now, Linq to Sql is a linq provider written specifically for SQL Server. Included in this provider is an OR/M, that gives you some handy-dandy functionality (like typing out all your sql tables, so you get a robust design-time view of your database schema.)

Some people also make a scripting language for their system, or implements an interpreter for a subset of an existing language. This is also a possible route to go. Bottom line is: When you get the code to load, only your imagination should be able to stop you. Good luck."
8157,872.0,2008-08-11T20:00:09Z,8140,3,"This is generally something thatÂ you'll have to expose yourself, so yes, it will be dependent on the language your system is written in (though often it's possible to write wrappers for other languages as well). If, for example, you had a program written in C, for Windows, plugins would be written for your program as DLLs.  At runtime, you would manually load these DLLs, and expose some interface to them.  For example, the DLLs might expose a gimme_the_interface() function which could accept a structure filled with function pointers.  These function pointers would allow the DLL to make calls, register callbacks, etc. If you were in C++, you would use the DLL system, except you would probably pass an object pointer instead of a struct, and the object would implement an interface which provided functionality (accomplishing the same thing as the struct, but less ugly).  For Java, you would load class files on-demand instead of DLLs, but the basic idea would be the same. In all cases, you'll need to define a standard interface between your code and the plugins, so that you can initialize the plugins, and so the plugins can interact with you. P.S. If you'd like to see a good example of a C++ plugin system, check out the foobar2000 SDK .  I haven't used it in quite a while, but it used to be really well done.  I assume it still is."
8164,521.0,2008-08-11T20:06:53Z,8140,4,"I've used event-based APIs for plugins in the past. You can insert hooks for plugins by dispatching events and providing access to the application state.

8173,1026.0,2008-08-11T20:15:06Z,8140,2,"I'm tempted to point you to the Design Patterns book for this generic question :p Seriously, I think the answer is no. You can't write extensible code by default, it will be both hard to write/extend and awfully inefficient (Mozilla started with the idea of being very extensible, used XPCOM everywhere, and now they realized it was a mistake and started to remove it where it doesn't make sense). what makes sense to do is to identify the pieces of your system that can be meaningfully extended and support a proper API for these cases (e.g. language support plug-ins in an editor). You'd use the relevant patterns, but the specific implementation depends on your platform/language choice. IMO, it also helps to use a dynamic language - makes it possible to tweak the core code at run time (when absolutely necessary). I appreciated that Mozilla's extensibility works that way when writing Firefox extensions."

Both Python and Lua are excellent languages that are used to script a large number of applications (Civ4 and blender use Python, Supreme Commander uses Lua, etc). If you are using C++, check out the boost python library.  Otherwise, python ships with headers that can be used in C, and does a fairly good job documenting the C/python API.  The documentation seemed less complete for Lua, but I may not have been looking hard enough.  Either way, you can offer a fairly solid scripting platform without a terrible amount of work.  It still isn't trivial, but it provides you with a very good base to work from."
8272,645.0,2008-08-11T22:08:57Z,7990,4,"Printing from a service is a bad idea. Network printers are connected ""per-user"". You can mark the service to be run as a particular user, but I'd consider that a bad security practice. You might be able to connect to a local printer, but I'd still hesitate before going this route. The best option is to have the service store the data and have a user-launched application do the printing by asking the service for the data. Or a common location that the data is stored, like a database. If you need to have the data printed as regular intervals, setup a Task event thru the Task Scheduler. Launching a process from a service will require knowing the user name and password, which again is bad security practice. As for the printing itself, use a third-party tool to generate the report will be the easiest."

{
     string keyAsString = key.ToString(); // btw, this is unnecessary
     string valAsString = h[key].ToString();

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(keyAsString + "" "" + valAsString);

     System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(key + "" "" + valAsString);
} And just the same for the other one with KeyValuePair, just use the non-generic version for Hashtable, and the generic version for Dictionary. So it's just as easy both ways, but Hashtable uses Object for both key and value, which means you will box all value types, and you don't have type safety, and Dictionary uses generic types and is thus better."

The UI asks the ServiceClass in the business tier for a service, namely getting a list of objects filtered by an object with the needed parameter data. Then the ServiceClass creates an instance of one of the repository classes in the data tier, and calls the GetList(ParameterType filters). Then the data tier accesses the database, pulls up the data, and maps it to the common format defined in the ""domain"" assembly. The BL has no more work to do with this data, so it outputs it to the UI. Then the UI wants to edit Item X. It sends the item (or business object) to the service in the Business Tier. The business tier validates the object, and if it is OK, it sends it to the data tier for storage. The UI knows the service in the business tier which again knows about the data tier. The UI is responsible for mapping the users data input to and from the objects, and the data tier is responsible for mapping the data in the db to and from the objects.

If I'm understanding your problem correctly, it sounds like you're trying to satisfy too much with a single interface, and that's just causing it to become cluttered.  Why not have two interfaces into the business layer?  One would be a simple, safe interface for the UI layer.  The other would be a lower-level interface for the data layer.

The following function ( print ) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type: void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
} Function Call When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this: func(print); would call func , passing the print function to it. Function Body As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly: for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
} Since func 's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f : void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }

9421,716.0,2008-08-13T02:34:47Z,9410,81,"This question already has the answer for defining function pointers, however they can get very messy, especially if you are going to be passing them around your application. To avoid this unpleasantness I would recommend that you typedef the function pointer into something more readable. For example. typedef void (*functiontype)(); Declares a function that returns void and takes no arguments. To create a function pointer to this type you can now do: void dosomething() { }

functiontype func = &dosomething;
func(); For a function that returns an int and takes a char you would do typedef int (*functiontype2)(char); and to use it int dosomethingwithchar(char a) { return 1; }

functiontype2 func2 = &dosomethingwithchar
int result = func2('a'); There are libraries that can help with turning function pointers into nice readable types. The boost function library is great and is well worth the effort! boost::function<int (char a)> functiontype2; is so much nicer than the above."
9502,1131.0,2008-08-13T06:08:24Z,9240,7,"If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields. Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields. E.g public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
} In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields. The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++ For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture' However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably."

I think many developers think of the database as a simple persistence layer for their objects, and are only concerned with the CRUD operations that those objects need.  Too much effort is being put into the ""impedence mismatch"" between object and relational models.  Here's an idea: stop trying. Write stored procedures to encapsulate your data.  Use results sets, DataSet, DataTable, SqlCommand (or the java/php/whatever equivalent) as needed from code to interact with the database.  You don't need those objects.  An excellent example is embedding a SqlDataSource into a .ASPX page. You shouldn't try to hide your data from anyone.  Developers need to understand exactly how and when they are interacting with the physical data store. Object-relational mappers are the devil.  Stop using them. Building enterprise applications is often an exercise in managing complexity.  You have to keep things as simple as possible, or you will have an absolutely un-maintainable system.  If you are willing to allow some coupling (which is inherent in any application anyway), you can do away with both your business logic layer and your data access layer (replacing them with stored procedures), and you won't need any of those interfaces."

Your Model should validate itself. Your Controller should read if the model is valid. If the Model is valid, save it to your db.  Redirect to /show to render the show View for your object. If the Model is invalid, save the form values and error messages in the TempData, and redirect to the New action again.  Fill your form fields with the data from TempData and show the error message(s). The validation frameworks will help you along in this process.

  programmatically control another application. Late binding uses CreateObject to create and instance of the
  application object, which you can then control. For example, to create
  a new instance of Excel using late binding: Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = CreateObject(""Excel.Application"") On the other hand, to manipulate an existing instance of Excel (if
  Excel is already open) you would use GetObject (regardless whether
  you're using early or late binding): Dim oXL As Object
 Set oXL = GetObject(, ""Excel.Application"") To use early binding, you first need to set a reference in your
  project to the application you want to manipulate. In the VB Editor of
  any Office application, or in VB itself, you do this by selecting
  Tools + References, and selecting the application you want from the
  list (e.g. âMicrosoft Excel 8.0 Object Libraryâ). To create a new instance of Excel using early binding: Dim oXL As Excel.Application
 Set oXL = New Excel.Application In either case, incidentally, you can first try to get an existing
  instance of Excel, and if that returns an error, you can create a new
  instance in your error handler."
10582,1190.0,2008-08-14T02:16:42Z,10580,12,"In compiled languages, the difference is stark. Java: //early binding:
public create_a_foo(*args) {
 return new Foo(args)
}
my_foo = create_a_foo();

//late binding:
public create_something(Class klass, *args) {
  klass.new_instance(args)
}
my_foo = create_something(Foo); In the first example, the compiler can do all sorts of neat stuff at compile time.  In the second, you just have to hope that whoever uses the method does so responsibly.  (Of course, newer JVMs support the Class<? extends Foo> klass structure, which can greatly reduce this risk.) Another benefit is that IDEs can hotlink to the class definition, since it's declared right there in the method.  The call to create something(Foo) might be _very far from the method definition, and if you're looking at the method definition, it might be nice to see the implementation. The major advantage of late binding is that it makes things like inversion-of-control easier, as well as certain other uses of polymorphism and duck-typing (if your language supports such things)."

my_foo = create_something(Foo) Because Ruby is (generally) not compiled, there isn't a compiler to do the nifty up-front stuff.  The growth of JRuby means that more Ruby is compiled these days, though, making it act more like Java, above. The issue with IDEs still stands: a platform like Eclipse can look up class definitions if you hard-code them, but cannot if you leave them up to the caller. Inversion-of-control is not terribly popular in Ruby, probably because of its extreme runtime flexibility, but Rails makes great use of late binding to reduce the amount of configuration necessary to get your application going."

This is pretty much just conjecture, though. It looks like you will either need to use on_exit() or structure your program so that the exit code doesn't matter.  It would not be unreasonable to have the last statement in your main function flip a global exited_cleanly variable to true.  In the function you register with atexit() , you could check this variable to determine how the program exited.

Both of these have a binary component, so you'll need an extra project in your solution to compile and run the tests. The framework we use is CxxTest , which is much lighter; it's headers only, and uses a Perl (!) script to scrape test suite information from your headers (suites inherit from CxxTest::Base, all your test methods' names start with ""test""). Obviously, this requires that you get Perl from one source or another , which adds overhead to your build environment setup."

public class ConfigurationItemsTest
{

Just consider each piece of your array an object, or, at the very least, the first level of the array as an object and each sub level as variables inside the object. The build a data structure that you populate with said objects and access the objects through the data structure's given accessors. Something like: class Schedule
{
  private String group;
  private String season;
  private String rundays;
  public Schedule() { this.group = null; this.season = null; this.rundays= null; }
  public void setGroup(String g) { this.group = g; }
  public String getGroup() { return this.group; }
  ...
}

public ArrayList<Schedule> schedules = new ArrayList<Schedule>();
Schedule s = new Schedule();
s.setGroup(...);
...
schedules.add(s);
... Of course that probably isn't right either. I'd make each season an object, and maybe each weekday list as an object too. Anyway, its more easily reused, understood, and extensible than a hobbled-together Hashtable that tries to imitate your PHP code. Of course, PHP has objects too, and you should use them in a similar fashion instead of your uber-arrays, wherever possible. I do understand the temptation to cheat, though.

Your file might looks like: A.Summer=M A.Spring=tTS B.Summer=T Usually I don't like to move static data like this to an external file because it increases the ""distance"" between the data and the code that uses it.  However, whenever you're dealing with nested Collections, especially maps, things can get real ugly, real fast. If you don't like this idea, maybe you can do something like this: public class WaterScheduler

For example, there are exactly four seasons, and they don't do or store anything.  How does it simplify anything to make them objects?  Wing is quite right that these should probably be constants (or maybe enums). What Bruce needs, at it's heart, is simply a lookup table.  He doesn't need a hierarchy of objects and interfaces; he needs a way to look up a schedule based on a season and a group identifier.  Turning things into objects only makes sense if they have responsibilities or state.  If they have neither, then they are simply identifiers, and building special objects for them just makes the codebase larger. You could build, e.g., Group objects that each contain a set of schedule strings (one for each season), but if all the Group object does is provide lookup functionality, then you've reinvented the lookup table in a much less intuitive fashion.  If he has to look up the group, and then lookup the schedule, all he has is a two-step lookup table that took longer to code, is more likely to be buggy, and will be harder to maintain."

Have you analyzed the query plan to see if you are missing any? http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes. Here's a site I found that touches on the subject: http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application: select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1 You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query: create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided) Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores. select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1; For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have. Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date. [Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects."

One thing i discovered earlier this year on our MySQL databases was the power of composite indexes. For example, if you are reporting on order numbers over date ranges, a composite index on the order number and order date columns could help. I believe MySQL can only use one index for the query so if you just had separate indexes on the order number and order date it would have to decide on just one of them to use. Using the EXPLAIN command can help determine this. To give an indication of the performance with good indexes (including numerous composite indexes), i can run queries joining 3 tables in our database and get almost instant results in most cases. For more complex reporting most of the queries run in under 10 seconds. These 3 tables have 33 million, 110 million and 140 millions rows respectively. Note that we had also already normalised these slightly to speed up our most common query on the database. More information regarding your tables and the types of reporting queries may allow further suggestions."

Scalability is not a concern here, either.  The needs of this system could increase by a million and the flat file would still work just fine. Certainly, it's possible that in the future needs will evolve to the point that it's worth moving to a database.  That's when you make the change.  Trying to future-proof an application never works, because we always assume incorrectly about future needs.  We can't say it'll only take a few hours to embed the database either, because we suck at estimating schedules, too.

Due to race conditions and similar things, your code might end up trying to call .Start on an existing thread object. Considering you don't post the details behind the check variable, it's impossible to know what might trigger this behavior. You should reorganize your code so that .Start is guaranteed to only be called on new objects. In short, you should put the Start method into the same if-statement as the one that creates a new thread object. Personally, I would try to reorganize the entire code so that I didn't need to create another thread, but wrap the code inside the thread object inside a loop so that the thread just keeps on going."

Much like the Microsoft world (I'm guessing - we're a Java shop), if you get all your products from a single vendor you get the bonus of tight integration. For an example of how they've done interoperability, view their interoperability page . Enough shilling. Generally speaking, I can summarize their general approach as: Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123). When you commit code, add ""PROJ-123"" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes. When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys. When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found. Specifically to your second problem: Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA. Instead, the Atlassian folks have provided a plugin to JIRA that will make a remote api call into Bamboo, asking the question ""Bamboo, to what builds am I (a JIRA issue) related?"". This is probably best explained with a screenshot ."

Even if you don't use branching/merging, this feature alone can be very valuable. Additionally, by having one 'authoritative' version of the source control, it becomes much easier to back up. Centralized vs. distributed... the difference is really that in distributed, there isn't necessarily one 'authoritative' version of the source control, although in practice people usually still do have the master tree. The big advantage to distributed source control is two-fold: When you use distributed source control, you have the whole source tree on your local machine. You can commit, create branches, and work pretty much as though you were all alone, and then when you're ready to push up your changes, you can promote them from your machine to the master copy. If you're working ""offline"" a lot, this can be a huge benefit. You don't have to ask anybody's permission to become a distributor of the source control. If person A is running the project, but person B and C want to make changes, and share those changes with each other, it becomes much easier with distributed source control."

If you had tagged the release, you could check out a working copy of it and use it to fix the bug. Then, you might choose to create a branch at the tag and check the bug fix into it.

The trunk folder holds your current ""main"" line of development. For many shops and situations, this is all they ever use... just a single working repository of code. The tags folder takes it one step further and allows you to ""checkpoint"" your code at certain points in time. For example, when you release a new build or sometimes even when you simply make a new build, you ""tag"" a copy into this folder. This just allows you to know exactly what your code looked like at that point in time. The branches folder holds different kinds of branches that you might need in special situations. Sometimes a branch is a place to work on experimental feature or features that might take a long time to get stable (therefore you don't want to introduce them into your main line just yet). Other times, a branch might represent the ""production"" copy of your code which can be edited and deployed independently from your main line of code which contains changes intended for a future release. Anyway, this is just one aspect of how to set up your system, but I think giving some thought to this structure is important."

13484,1199.0,2008-08-17T02:56:56Z,13470,1,"@ Jeff Atwood , your interpretation is a little off - the {1} means match exactly once, but has no effect on the ""capturing"" - the capturing occurs because of the parens - the braces only specify the number of times the pattern must match the source - once, as you say. I agree with @ Marius , even if his answer is a little terse and may come off as being flippant. Regular expressions are tough, if one's not used to using them, and the {1} in the question isn't quite error - in systems that support it, it does mean ""exactly one match"". In this sense, it doesn't really do anything. Unfortunately, contrary to a now-deleted post, it doesn't keep the regexp from matching http:// http://example.org , since the \S+ at the end will match one or more non-whitespace characters, including the http://example.org in http:// http://example.org (verified using Python 2.5, just in case my regexp reading was off). So, the regexp given isn't really the best. I'm not a URL expert, but probably something limiting the appearance of "":""s and ""//""s after the first one would be necessary (but hardly sufficient) to ensure good URLs."

  Unfortunately for an Insert, both the

This perfect storm may not be attainable by a tester after the fact. Are we talking about QA or validation? I think of QA along the lines of inspection checklists, code standards enforcement, UI guidelines, etc. If we're talking validation, it doesn't make sense for devs to spend a lot of time authoring and executing formal test cases, but devs must provide all of the rationale and design documentation needed to author good tests."

""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance. I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field a lot if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks). Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better). Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality. On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.

  Tools: NUnit / xUnit / whatever home-made tool Customer tests verify that the code works as the customer wanted it to.
The tests should be very easy to write, shouldn't require the customer to learn .NET/Java. Else the customer wont write those tests (although he may require some help of a developer). Fit for example uses HTML tables that can be written in Word.
Tools: FIT
Regression tools also lie here. Record-replay. The right half better utilizes the time & effort of good testers. e.g. No automated test can tell you whether X dialog is usable. Humans are better at this than machines. Usability. Try to Break the System down,( catch unhandled failure scenarios, enter null values ). Basically catch things that the developer missed. Property testing again requires humans. Here you check customer mandated properties that are required by your system. e.g. Performance - does your search dialog meet the 2 sec response time ? Security- can someone hack into this System ? etc. Availability - is your system online 99.99% of the time ? Testers shouldn't be spending time executing test-plans on the left half.

In the case of Linq, it is true that there will be no performance difference with simple CRUD queries. But keep a few things in mind when making this decision: using any ORM couples you tightly to your data model.  A DBA has no freedom to make changes to the data model without forcing you to change your compiled code.  With stored procedures, you can hide these sorts of changes to an extent, since the parameter list and results set(s) returned from a procedure represent its contract, and the innards can be changed around, just so long as that contract is still met. And also, if Linq is used for more complex queries, tuning the database becomes a much more difficult task.  When a stored procedure is running slow, the DBA can totally focus on the code in isolation, and has lots of options, just so that contract is still satisfied when he/she is done. I have seen many, many cases where serious problems in an application were addressed by changes to the schema and code in stored procedures without any change to deployed, compiled code. Perhaps a hybird approach would be nice with Linq?  Linq can, of course, be used to call stored procedures."

Because Linq can support querying anything that implements the IQueryable interface, you will be able to use the same syntax to query XML, Objects and any other datasource without having to learn a new syntax"

Alternatively you can group your JS into application functional areas if that's easier for you to navigate. If you put all your JS files into one directory, you can have your server-side environment (PHP for instance) loop through each file in that directory and output a <script src='/path/to/js/$file.js' type='text/javascript'> in some header file that is included by all your UI pages. You'll find this auto-loading especially handy if you're regularly creating and removing JS files.

I'd recommend keeping files split up for development and then create a build script to combine/compile everything. Also, as a good rule of thumb, make sure you include your JavaScript toward the end of your page. If JavaScript is included in the header (or anywhere early in the page), it will stop all other requests from being made until it is loaded, even if pipelining is turned on.

I find that doing it database-schema-first gets the system stuck in a data-driven-design that is difficult to abstract from persistence. We try to do domain model designs first and then base the database schema on those. And then there's the infrastructure design: the team should settle on conventions on how to structure the program first and foremost. And then we work together to agree first on a design for the common functionality of the system (e.g., things everyone needs like persistence, logging, etc.). This becomes the framework of the system. We all work on that together first before we split the rest of the functionalities amongst ourselves."

First read the spec like a story (skimming through it). Don't stop at every requirement to analyze it right there and then. This will allow you to get an overall picture of the system without too many details. At this point you would start identifying the major functional components of the system. Start putting these down (use a mindmap tool if you like). Then take each component and start exploding it (and tying each detail with requirements in the spec document). Do this for all components, till you have covered all requirements. Now, you should start looking at relationships between the components, and whether there are repetitions of features or functions across the various components (which you can then pull out to create utility components, or such). Around now, you would have a good detailed map of your requirements in your mind. NOW, you should think of designing the database, ER diagrams, Class Design, DFDs, deployment, etc. The problem with doing the last step first is that you can get bogged down in the complexity of your system without really gaining an overall understanding in the first place."

You can use Visual Studio to open 3rd-party executables, and browse embedded resources (dialogs, string tables, images, etc) stored within.

Straight out of university, I was asked to design the database and business logic layer, while other people would take care of the UI. Meanwhile the boss was looking over my shoulder, unwilling to let go of what used to be his baby and was now mine, and poking his finger in it. Three years later, developers were fleeing the company and we were still X months away from actually selling anything. The big mistake was in being too ambitious. If this is your first job, you will make mistakes and you will need to change how things work long after you've written them. We had all sorts of features that made the system more complicated than it needed to be, both on the database level and in the API that it presented to other developers. In the end, the whole thing was just far too complicated to support all at once and just died. So my advice: If you're not sure about taking on such a big job single-handed, don't. Tell your employers, and get them to find or hire somebody for you to work with who can help you out. If people need to be added to the project, then it should be done near the start rather than after stuff starts going wrong. Think very carefully about what the product is for, and to boil it down to the simplest set of requirements you can think of. If the people giving you the spec aren't technical, try to see past what they've written to what will actually work and make money. Talk to customers and salespeople, and understand the market. There's no shame in admitting you're wrong. If it turns out that the entire system needs to be rewritten, because you made some mistake in your first version, then it's better to admit this as soon as possible so you can get to it. Correspondingly, don't try to make an architecture that can anticipate every possible contingency in your first version, because you don't know what every contingency is and will just get it wrong. Write once with an eye to throwing away and starting again - you may not have to, the first version may be fine, but admit it if you do."

The ORM lets you customize some business constraints around your object model and pass it around with out actually knowing how it should be committed to the database.  Everything related to inserting, updating, and deleting happens in the object and doesn't really have to worry the developer too much.

You can especially run into problems where you are querying the database for each record or your classes are tightly coupled to your database, creating inflexibility in both.

How long do you expect the data to be? How random? If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length.  If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies. GetHashCode should be a lot quicker than Equals , but doesn't need to be unique. Two identical things must never have different hash codes.

The larger your data set and the smaller m is, the more likely you'll get a collision ... two pieces of data resolving to the same hash. The simplest hash I ever learned was simply XORing all the bytes together.  It's easy, faster than most complicated hash algorithms and a halfway decent general-purpose hash algorithm for small data sets.  It's the Bubble Sort of hash algorithms really.  Since the simple implementation would leave you with 8 bits, that's only 256 hashes ... not so hot.  You could XOR chunks instead of individal bytes, but then the algorithm gets much more complicated. So certainly, the cryptographic algorithms are maybe doing some stuff you don't need ... but they're also a huge step up in general-purpose hash quality.  The MD5 hash you're using has 128 bits, with billions and billions of possible hashes.  The only way you're likely to get something better is to take some representative samples of the data you expect to be going through your application and try various algorithms on it to see how many collisions you get.

If you have general routines for executing a stored procedure, or sql statement, that return a dataset, then using static methods would make more sense to me, since you don't need a permanent reference to an object that created the dataset for you. I'd use a static method as well if I created a DB Layer that returned a strongly-typed class or collection as its result. If on the other hand you want to create an instance of a class, using a given parameter like an ID (see @barret-conrad's answer), to connect to the DB and get the necessary record, then you'd probably not want to use a static method on the class.  But even then I'd say you'd probably have some sort of DB Helper class that DID have static methods that your other class was relying on."

  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase
  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count? I have a few ideas and questions: 1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer ""throwing up its hands"" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be. 2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using PDFSharp after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable. 3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API? My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS). Not solutions, per se, but ideas.  Hope it helps."

     class Cons : List<a> {
         a head;
         List<a> tail;
     }
     class Nil : List<a> {}
 } Of course Haskell's type system allows more ... interesting use of type parameters but this is just a simple example.  With regards to the ""Algebraic Type"" name, i've honestly never been entirely sure of the exact reason for them being named that, but have assumed that it's due the mathematical underpinnings of the type system.  I believe that the reason boils down to the theoretical definition of an ADT being the ""product of a set of constructors"", however it's been a couple of years since i escaped university so i can no longer remember the specifics. [Edit: Thanks to Chris Conway for pointing out my foolish error, ADT are of course sum types, the constructors providing the product/tuple of fields]"

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc). To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with. Some help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101 . Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios. OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend: OSGi R4 Specification : Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them. Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example). Some links: OSGi best practices and using Apache Felix Peter Kriens and BJ Hargrave in a Sun presentation on OSGi best practices one key OSGi concept are Services, learn why and how they supplant the Listener pattern with the Whiteboard pattern The Spring DM Google Group is very responsive and friendly in my experience The Spring DM Google Group is no longer active and has moved to Eclipse.org as the Gemini Blueprint project which has a forum here ."

</Project> (Sorry if it's a little dense.  Markdown seems to be stripping out the blank lines.) It's pretty simple though once you understand the concepts and all the dependencies are handled automatically.  I should note that we use Visual Studio project files, which have a lot of logic built into them, but this system allows people to build almost identically both within the Visual Studio IDE or at the command line and still gives you the flexibility of adding things to the canonical build like the xUnit testing you see in the script above. The one PropertyGroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized, like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks. The ItemGroup is where the logic happens that finds all the .csproj files in the tree. Then there are the targets, which most people familiar with make, nAnt or MSBuild should be able to follow.  If you call the Build target, it calls _Compile, _ Deploy and __Test.  The Clean target calls MSBuild on all the project files for them to clean up their directories and then the global deployment directory is deleted.  Rebuild calls Clean and then Build."

You will certainly develop expertise in specific areas but it is likely to be a product of either personal interest or work necessity. Over time the stuff you are able to transfer across languages and problem domains is at the heart of what makes good programmers.

But if you are really starting off on your career then you should be least worried about the specialization thing. All APIs, frameworks and skills that you expect that gives you a long term existence in the field is not going to happen. Technology seems changing a lot and you should be versatile and flexible enough to learn anything. The knowledge you acquire on one platform/api/framework doesn't die off. You can apply the skills to the next greatest platform/api/framework. That being said you should just stop worrying about the future and concentrate on the basics. DataStructures, Algorithm Analysis and Design, Compiler Design, Operating system design are the bare minimum stuff you need.  And further you should be willing to go back and read tho books in those field any time in your career. Thats all is required. Good luck. Sorry if I sounded like a big ass advisor; but thats what I think. :-)"

Here's how to get started on it: Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the OpenGL Extension Registry . Check if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use. Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card. Recent versions of NVIDIA OpenGL SDK ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps. Download GLEW and unzip it. Add the GLEW bin path to your Windows PATH environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the glew32.dll in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs. Add the GLEW include path to your compiler's include directory list. Add the GLEW lib path to your compiler's library directory list. Instruct your compiler to use glew32.lib during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code: #pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"") Add a #include <GL/glew.h> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include glew.h .) Initialize GLEW using glewInit() after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup. if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
} Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named GLEW _your_extension_name which is exposed by GLEW. Example: if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
} That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows."

Firebug/Venkman make for nice debuggers, but they would be painful for figuring out these kinds of problems for someone else's code, IMO.

I thought I'd never need to change from a List<T> but had to later change to use a custom list library for the extra functionality it provided. Because I'd only returned an IList<T> none of the people that used the library had to change their code. Of course that only need apply to methods that are externally visible (i.e. public methods).

The Windows.Forms implementation is still a little buggy (for example, TrayIcon's don't work) but it has come a long way. Besides, GTK# is a better toolkit than Windows Forms as it is. On the web side, Mono has implemented enough of ASP.NET to run most sites perfectly. The difficulty here is finding a host that has mod_mono installed on apache, or doing it yourself if you have shell access to your host. Either way, Mono is great, and stable. Key things to remember when creating a cross platform program: Use GTK# instead of Windows.Forms Ensure to properly case your filenames Use Path.Separator instead of hardcoding ""\"" , also use Environment.NewLine instead of ""\n"" . Do not use any P/Invoked calls to Win32 API. Do not use the Windows Registry."

The easiest way to check for your specific project is to run the Mono Migration Analyzer (MoMA) . The benefit is that it will notify the Mono team of issues which will prevent you from using Mono (if any), which lets them prioritize their work. I recently ran MoMA on SubSonic and found only one issue - a weird use of Nullable types. That's a big codebase, so the coverage there was pretty impressive. Mono is in active use in several commercial as well as open source products . It's in use in some large applications, such as Wikipedia and the Mozilla Developer Center , and has been used in embedded applications such as the Sansa MP3 players and powers thousands of published games.

That said, people will usually only do that if they have a use for the project themselves and raising awareness can be just as hard as marketing a commercial project - you will probably find only a few people use it having stumbled upon the project through an obscure Google search! As such, whilst there are a lot of development oriented advantages, even if there aren't many (or any) actual users, it looks very good from a business/company perspective that your organisation is supporting the release of internal projects under open source licenses.

That said, study up on the technicals a bit so that they can communicate effectively with you. Edit (8/24/08):You should know something about the underlying technicals; not necessarily all .NET stuff either (garbage collection, .config files, pipes and services if you're running services adjacent to your project's main focus, stuff like that). Higher-reaching concepts would probably include WPF (maybe Silverlight as well), LINQ (or your ORM of choice), as well as the Vista bridge and related bridging code if your project includes desktop apps at all. Those three things seem to be the focus for this round of .NET. Something else that's very important to have at least a passing knowledge of is the ways that .NET code can/must interoperate with native code: P/Invoke, Runtime Callable Wrapping and COM Callable Wrapping.

Nevertheless, I'll try to provide some information for you to decide. On UNIX, fork() creates a clone of your process from the place where you called fork. Meaning, if I have the following process: #include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf( ""hi 2 u\n"" );
    int mypid = fork();

    if( 0 == mypid )
        printf( ""lol child\n"" );
    else
        printf( ""lol parent\n"" );

    return( 0 );
} The output will look as follows: hi 2 u lol child lol parent When you fork() the pid returned in the child is 0, and the pid returned in the parent is the child's pid. Notice that ""hi2u"" is only printed once... by the parent . execve() and its family of functions are almost always used with fork(). execve() and the like overwrite the current stackframe with the name of the application you pass to it. execve() is almost always used with fork() where you fork a child process and if you're the parent you do whatever you need to keep doing and if you're the child you exec a new process. execve() is also almost always used with waitpid() -- waitpid takes a pid of a child process and, quite literally, waits until the child terminates and returns the child's exit status to you. Using this information, you should be able to write a very basic shell; one that takes process names on the command line and runs processes you tell it to. Of course, shells do more than that, like piping input and output, but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork() , execve() and waitpid() . NOTE: This is *nix specific! This will NOT work on Windows. Hope this helped."

It is impossible to be an expert in all facets of .Net development.  The platform is just too big.  The same goes for Java.  The only thing Silverlight has going for it from a skills perspective is that you can code in your favorite .Net language.  That advantage is fairly small if you are already doing any significant web development that utilizes JavaScript since Action script is a variation.

Skill sets will be easier to find as far as finding C# or VB developers vs finding ActionScript guru's.  However there is the trade off: Design experience is an investment not only in Designers with artistic skill, but also in the knowledge and tools provided by Adobe.  You can nearly guarantee that a professional designer uses a mac and has experience with Adobe tools. Right now the Silverlight designer tools are half baked and can be a headache.  For instance Blend errors when trying to render any xaml containing an IValueConverter, this is problematic.  I have no idea what the Adobe developer experience is, I'm sure it is as hairy. So at this stage of the game it comes down to human resources: If you have .NET experience and little invested in Design skills go Silverlight. Programming skills/tools will be transferable.
If you have Design experience and skill set go with Flex.  Designer skills/tools will be transferable. Either way both client platforms require communication with services to get data, so you will always leverage your existing programing expertise on the back end. Paraphrased Jon's opinion from a different point of view: I think you should look at Flex as a long-term play, just as Adobe seems to be doing. There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flex when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are more reasons Flex is a good direction to move in: Second mover advantage - Just as
Adobe built a ""better Java Applet""
with Flash, they're able to look at
how you'd design a runtime from
scratch, today. They have the
advantage of knowing how people use
the web today, something the
inventors of existing client
platforms could never have
accurately guessed. .NET can add
features, but they can't
realistically chuck the platform and
start over. Designer familiarity - While
Flex/AIR is a new programing model,
it's not entirely unfamiliar to
designers. They'll ""get"" the way
Flex works a lot more quickly than
they'll understand firing up a new
design environment with new feature
poor tools and new animation
paradigms. Being rid of the RGB color model in
Silverlight- .NET was originally
built for windows and it is at the
core of how it works. Flex ditched a
long time ago for an design-centric
model. All your tools run on your mac. Nuff
said. Cool features - Silverlight still
has some catching up to do with
Flash on some obvious features (like
webcam / mic integration, or 3d /
graphics acceleration)."

The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all NSTextView s; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to Preferences -> Code Sense and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++. Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options: Back in Preferences ,go to Key Bindings , and then, under Menu Key Bindings , assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do Use the CompletionPrefix .  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields. You can see a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated CompletionPrefix es at Crooked Spin . You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file /Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro .  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly. Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve."

  each directory, but to add this would
  make the code substantially more messy
  in it's current state.. This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well: Get a list of all the files Check for ""required"" files You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files: checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
} As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex): check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
} Split the filename based on the delimiter. Check each of the parts. Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the parts and patterns have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order. Ignored and required files can be listed.  The . and .. files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of svn:ignore properties, but globbing is natural for listing files. Here start_dir would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful. The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of parts , which makes sense but adds complexity. Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?"

And it lets you do a lot of ""database-y"" things in regular C# code. It's difficult to explain just how incredibly powerful that can be. Consider how much having solid, well designed generic data structures (such as list, stack, dictionary/hash, etc.) included in common frameworks has improved the state of development in modern languages. Precisely because using these data structures is very common and reducing the intellectual overhead of using them is a huge benefit. LINQ doesn't do anything you can't do yourself, but it makes a lot of operations a lot more straightforward and a lot easier. Consider the time-honored example of removing duplicates from a non-ordered list. In a lower level language like C or C++ you'd probably have to sort the list and maintain two indices into the list as you removed dupes. In a language with hashes (Java, C#, Javascript, Perl, etc.) you could create a hash where the keys are the unique values, then extract the keys into a new list. With LINQ you could just do this: int[] data = { 0, 1, 3, 3, 7, 8, 0, 9, 2, 1 };

var uniqueData = data.GroupBy(i => i).Select(g => g.Key);"

If you aim to launch a site next week and want a huge audience, Silverlight is not an option. If you aim to launch a really cool application that everyone would want to use it's a bit different, if your app is good enough your target audience may install Silverlight just to be able to run it. As for the second question its a matter of how easy it is to develop applications in Silverlight. Flex isn't just a set of widgets, it's a very big framework that does a lot of thing that ease the work of the developer. You could write the same applications using only the core Flash API, but it would be very much more work.

But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.) So, there are 2 options: Download and build from their daily snapshot . Get the patch for your working wxWidgets installation. I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see this .

$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp After patching, recompile the wxWidgets libraries. To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required. An attribute list needs to be passed to the wxGLCanvas constructor: int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling

    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint& pos,

If you are using Sybase or SQL Server 2008 you can create variables of type date and assign them your datetime values. The database engine gets rid of the time for you. Here's a quick and dirty test to illustrate (Code is in Sybase dialect): declare @date1 date
declare @date2 date
set @date1='2008-1-1 10:00'
set @date2='2008-1-1 22:00'
if @date1=@date2

Right, but when you say you're interested in activity for Jan 1st 2008 EST: SELECT @activityDateMidnight = '1/1/2008', @activityDateTZ = 'EST' you just need to convert that to GMT (I'm ignoring the complication of querying for the day before EST goes to EDT, or vice versa): Table: TimeZone

I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ... Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, array_care[4][4][4] for 1,2, and 6. The array_care[4][4][4] will hold the end result. Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4] to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6. We need to define some temporary indexes: int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}; We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes: int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0; This order is important for doing what you requested. Define a termination flag: bool terminate=false; Now we can create our loop: while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) && (i < 8))

if (i < 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;

I suggest making a 1D array for your destination, then looping through each element in your array adding the value to the destination with the index of the dimension of interest. If you are using arbitrary number of dimensions, you must have a way of addressing elements (I would be curious how you are implementing this).  Your implementation of this will affect how you set the destination index.  But an obvious way would be with if statements checked in the iteration loops."

Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else."

Bear in mind that classes provide the advantage of methods and access control, as well. So if you wanted to ensure that people weren't changing weights to negative numbers, you could make the weight field private and provide some accessor methods, like getWeight() and setWeight() . Inside setWeight() , you could do some value checking, like so: public function setWeight($weight)
{

With the arrays you're incurring cost in harder to read and maintain code, you can't unit test the code as easily and with a good class structure other developers should find it easier to understand if they need to take it on.

That doesn't mean it's solved the fundamental problem of software messiness, and it doesn't mean the average developer is an OOP expert. But the modularization of function into object-components has certainly reduced the amount of spaghetti code out there in the world. I can think of dozens of libraries off the top of my head which are beautifully reusable and which have saved time and money that can never be calculated. But to the extent that OOP has been a waste of time, I'd say it's because of lack of programmer training, compounded by the steep learning curve of learning a language specific OOP mapping.

OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies. Of course, this is only true for âgoodâ OOP design. Sloppy design won't give any advantage. But good, decoupled design can be modelled very well using OOP and not well using other techniques. There are much better, more universal models ( Haskell's type model comes to mind) but these are also often more complicated and/or difficult to implement efficiently. OOP is a good trade-off between extremes."

I think that technically sound approaches (LSP being the obvious thing) make hard to use , but if we don't use such approaches it makes the code brittle and inextensible anyway (because we can no longer reason about it).

More significantly, since software is already fundamentally too hard for normal humans to write reliably and accurately, should we really be extolling a technique that is consistently taught poorly and appears hard to learn?

You can't really argue against those properties - there is no trade-off made and it is always a cleaner way to modulize things. Other aspects of OOP including inheritance and polymorphism are important too, but as others have alluded to, those are commonly over used. ie: Sometimes people use inheritance and/or polymorphism because they can, not because they should have. They are powerful concepts and very useful, but need to be used wisely and are not automatic winning advantages of OOP. Relative to re-use. I agree re-use is over sold for OOP. It is a possible side effect of well defined objects, typically of more primitive/generic classes and is a direct result of the encapsulation and information hiding concepts.
